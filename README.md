This Project is based on creating Printf. In this project we are tasked with creating a function that works just like printf, in terms of how printf handle certain format specifiers etc.



Instructions for task 0:

Write a function that produces output according to a format.

Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);

Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).

write output to stdout, the standard output stream.

Format is a string. And we need to handle the 'c', 's' and '%' format specifiers.

You don’t have to reproduce the buffer handling of the C library printf function.

You don’t have to handle the flag characters.

You don’t have to handle field width.

You don’t have to handle precision.

You don’t have to handle the length modifiers.


Instructions for task 1:

Handle 'd' and 'i' format specifiers.

You don’t have to handle the flag characters.

You don’t have to handle field width.

You don’t have to handle precision.

You don’t have to handle the length modifiers.
